The first document contains SQL code I wrote in SMSS to understand Covid-19 data from Our World in Data <https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus>.
I showcase skills including creating CTEs and views which I later exported and used in Tableau.

The second document contains the same queries, but the code was modified to be used in BigQuery.  I created the same views using BigQuery's view features.
